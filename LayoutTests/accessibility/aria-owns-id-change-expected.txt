This test ensures aria-owns relationships update when a target element's id changes.

Initial state - owner should have 2 children (Item 1 + owned button), other-owner should have 1 child:
PASS: owner.childrenCount === 2
PASS: owner.childAtIndex(1).role.toLowerCase().includes('button') === true
PASS: otherOwner.childrenCount === 1

Changing the owned element's id from 'owned' to 'not-owned':
document.getElementById('owned').id = 'not-owned'

Owner should now only have 1 child (Item 1):
PASS: owner.childrenCount === 1

Changing the element's id back to 'owned':
document.getElementById('not-owned').id = 'owned'

Owner should now have 2 children again:
PASS: owner.childrenCount === 2
PASS: owner.childAtIndex(1).role.toLowerCase().includes('button') === true

Testing ownership transfer - changing id to match other-owner's aria-owns:
document.getElementById('owned').id = 'different-id'

Owner should have 1 child, other-owner should have 2 children:
PASS: owner.childrenCount === 1
PASS: otherOwner.childrenCount === 2
PASS: otherOwner.childAtIndex(1).role.toLowerCase().includes('button') === true

PASS successfullyParsed is true
