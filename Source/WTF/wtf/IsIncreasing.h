// `IsIncreasing` is a utility to check that a series of numbers are increasing.
//
// On example usage is for generated code to check the relative order of the members of a struct:
//
//   Given struct:
//
//     struct Foo {
//         int a;
//         int b;
//         int c;
//     };
//
//   You can statically assert:
//
//     static_assert(IsIncreasing<
//           0
//         , offsetof(Foo, a)
//         , offsetof(Foo, b)
//         , offsetof(Foo, c)
//     >);
